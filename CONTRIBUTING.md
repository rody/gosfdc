# How to contribute

We love pull requests. And following this guidelines will make your pull request easier to merge.

If you want to contribute but don’t know what to do, take a look at these two labels: [help wanted](https://github.com/rody/gosfdc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) and [good first issue](https://github.com/rody/gosfdc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

_[Use GitHub interface](https://blog.sapegin.me/all/open-source-for-everyone/) for simple documentation changes, otherwise follow the steps below._

## Prerequisites

- If it’s your first pull request, watch [this amazing course](http://makeapullrequest.com/) by [Kent C. Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds).
- Fork the repository and clone your fork.
- Install dependencies: `go mod tidy`.

**Don’t forget to add tests and update documentation for your changes.**

## Other notes

## Need help?

If you want to contribute but have any questions, concerns or doubts, feel free to ping maintainers. Ideally create a pull request with `WIP` (Work in progress) in its title and ask questions in the pull request description.
